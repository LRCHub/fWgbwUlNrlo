Not to us, oh God
But to your name all glory
We give thanks and praise
To you alone forever
Praise him all the earth
All creation bows to you
Nations stand in awe
He is the King of Glory

To you, oh Lord
You reign in heaven and on earth
To you alone
As the earth is filled with the knowledge
Of the Lord
Call upon his name
The orphans and the widows
He'll lift you up again
And shower you with mercy
Bless you all my soul
Robed with strength and majesty
The lion and the lamb
Together come and worship

To you, oh Lord
You reign in heaven and on earth
To you alone
As the earth is filled with your wonder
To you, oh Lord
You reign in heaven and on earth
To you alone
As the earth is filled with the knowledge
Of the Lord
All to you

Both now and evermore
Come and drink again
Be filled with living water
Call upon his name
He is the King of Glory
