"Zenith"
(Feat. Prudence & Morgan Phalen)

I lost the picture
I can feel it fading out my memory
Though I remember
When the moon was shining down on you and me

Dream, it's all over
I've been waiting for another sight to see
Chills on my shoulder
And I wish I was the only one to leave

We once were electric
Now we're flatlined
We're running too late and
Running out of time

You're getting colder
But I know you're still out there in the haze
Now that I'm older
I keep thinking 'bout the void all day

I know it's over
I can see you walking off the silver screen
It makes me wonder
Will I ever make it to the final scene?

We once were electric
Now we're flatlined
We're running too late and
Running out of time

We once were electric
Now we're flatlined
We're running too late and
Running out of time
